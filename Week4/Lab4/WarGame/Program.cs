                            Add a PlayGame method to the CardWars class.
                            It should have 3 parameters: List<string> for the cards, List<HighScore> for the high scores, and a string for the name of the high score file.

                            1.	Call shuffle passing in the list of cards.
                            2.	Take the shuffled list and split it into 2 equal lists: playerCards and npcCards.
                            3.	Create 3 lists: playerPile, npcPile, unclaimedPile.
                            4.	Loop while the playerCards list is not empty
                                a.	Print out the first card from playerCards and npcCards (see example below on how to print)
                                b.	Add the first card from playerCards and npcCards to the unclaimed pile.
                                c.	Call CompareCards and pass the first card from the playerCards and npcCards.
                                    i.	NOTE: CompareCards will return -1 if the card1 < card2, 0 if card1 = card2, 1 if card1 > card2
                                d.	If CompareCards returns -1, add the unclaimed pile to the npcPile. Clear the unclaimed pile. Print NPC wins.
                                e.	If CompareCards returns 1, add the unclaimed pile to the playerPile. Clear the unclaimed pile. Print player wins.
                                f.	Remove the first card from the playerCards and npcCards.
                            5.	After the loop, check who won. Print the counts from the playerPile and npcPile lists.
                                a.	If the npcPile has more cards, print that the npc won the round.
                                b.	If the npcPile has the same number of cards as the playerPile, print that it was a tie.
                                c.	Else, the playerPile has more cards. Print out that the player won and check if it’s a new high score.
                                    i.	NOTE: the last score in the high score list is the smallest high score. Therefore, if the playerPile count is greater than the last score in the high score list, the player has a new high score.
                                    ii.	If the player’s score is a new high score, 
                                        1.	Get the user’s name using Input.GetString
                                        2.	loop from the beginning of the high score list
                                        3.	If the player score is >= the high score in the list, then 
                                            a.	insert a new high score object into the list at that index
                                            b.	remove the last score in the list
                                            c.	call SaveHighScores (see part A-3)
                                            d.  Call ShowHighScores to display the new top 10.
